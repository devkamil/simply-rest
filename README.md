The program is used to extract data about a particular user from GitHubAPI.

To run the program correctly, use Maven (command: "mvn spring-boot: run"), and then type in the URL: "http://localhost:8080/user/info/" plus the name of the one you are interested in. For example, "http://localhost:8080/user/info/octocat".
